The given task at hand
Problem statement :- For a given dataset (problem) which is the best classification algorithm (as per accuracy)
We need to work on ensemble learning (modelling) on the questions at hand
The questions that i've asked were
1) What is the most and the least used colour in the link_colour and the sidebar_colour column by all genders (brands included)?

2) What is the top 20 most used words and top 20 least used words (brands included) ?

The classification algorithms that i've used are:
1) Ridge Classifier

2) SGD Classifier

3) Logistic regression

I have managed to plot the accuracies of all the classifiers.
I have used the model_test() to run logistic regression and found out accuracy for that, once that is done, I pass that on to the predictor function to find the most and the least used link_colour or words.
